**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
- **Creating Classes**: Classes are templates that define the structure and behavior of objects. They contain fields, properties, methods, and events.
- **Objects**: Objects are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities and encapsulate data and behavior.
- **Fields**: Fields are variables within a class that store data.
- **Properties**: Properties provide controlled access to fields and can have get and set methods.
- **Methods**: Methods contain code that performs actions or calculations.
- **Events**: Events allow objects to communicate and respond to specific occurrences.
- **Constructors and Destructors**: Constructors initialize objects, and destructors (finalizers) clean up resources when objects are no longer needed.

**Exception Handling**:
- **Models**: Models are representations of objects, often used in design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller).
- **Statements**: Statements are blocks of code that perform specific tasks or operations.
  
**File Handling**:
- **Using File Stream Class**: The FileStream class provides a way to read from or write to files.
- **File Mode, File Share, File Access Enumerations**: These enumerations provide control over file opening, sharing, and access modes.
- **Opening or Creating Files with File Stream Class**: You can open or create files using the FileStream class.
- **Reading and Writing Text using StreamReader and StreamWriter Classes**: These classes simplify reading and writing text data to files.

**Data Access with ADO.NET**:
- **Databases**: Databases are organized collections of data. SQL Server is an example of a database management system.
- **Data Access with Server Explorer**: Server Explorer in Visual Studio allows you to connect to databases, manage connections, and view database objects.
- **Data Adapter and Data Sets**: Data adapters fill data sets with data from databases, and data sets are in-memory representations of data.
- **ADO.NET Objects and Basic SQL**: ADO.NET provides objects like Connection, Command, DataAdapter, and DataSet for database operations. SQL is used to query and manipulate data.
- **Connection with SQL Server**: You can establish a connection to a SQL Server database using a ConnectionString and SqlConnection object.
