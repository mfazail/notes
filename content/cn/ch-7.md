CN CH7

1. **Overview of Data (Analog & Digital)**:
   Data can be in analog or digital form. Analog data is continuous and represents real-world quantities with a range of values. Digital data is discrete and represented using binary digits (0s and 1s).

2. **Signal (Analog & Digital)**:
   Signals carry data over communication channels. Analog signals are continuous and vary smoothly, while digital signals are discrete and have distinct levels representing binary values.

3. **Transmission (Analog & Digital)**:
   Analog transmission involves sending analog signals over a communication medium, while digital transmission involves sending digital signals. Digital transmission is more immune to noise and distortion.

4. **Transmission Media (Guided & Unguided)**:
   - **Guided Media**: Physical media with a defined path for signal transmission, such as twisted-pair cables, coaxial cables, and fiber-optic cables.
   - **Unguided Media**: Wireless media with no fixed path, such as radio waves and microwaves, used for wireless communication.

5. **Circuit Switching: Time Division & Space Division Switching**:
   - **Time Division Switching**: In this method, multiple devices share the same communication channel by taking turns transmitting data during specific time slots.
   - **Space Division Switching**: In this method, multiple communication channels are physically separated, and each device gets its dedicated channel.

6. **TDM Bus (Time Division Multiplexing Bus)**:
   TDM bus is a technique where multiple devices share a single communication channel by taking turns sending data during predefined time slots.

7. **Telephone Network**:
   The telephone network is a communication system designed for voice transmission using circuit switching. It consists of various components like telephones, exchanges, and transmission lines.
