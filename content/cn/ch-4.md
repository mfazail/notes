CN CH4

1. **Internetworking & Devices**:
   Internetworking involves connecting multiple networks to create a larger interconnected network. Various devices are used for this purpose:
   - **Repeaters**: Extend the reach of a network by amplifying and retransmitting signals.
   - **Hubs**: Simple devices that connect multiple devices in a network segment. Data sent to one port is broadcast to all other ports.
   - **Bridges**: Connects multiple network segments and forwards data only to the relevant segment.
   - **Switches**: More advanced than hubs, switches intelligently forward data only to the intended recipient.
   - **Router**: Determines the best path for data to travel between networks, based on routing tables and protocols.
   - **Gateway**: Connects different types of networks, translating protocols if needed.

2. **Addressing: Internet Address, Classful Address**:
   Internet addresses, known as IP addresses, are used to uniquely identify devices on a network. Classful addressing divides addresses into different classes (A, B, C, D, E), each with different size allocations for network and host portions.

3. **Routing: Techniques, Static vs. Dynamic Routing**:
   Routing involves finding the best path for data to travel from source to destination. Techniques include:
   - **Static Routing**: Admin-defined routes that don't change unless manually updated.
   - **Dynamic Routing**: Routes are determined by routing protocols that adapt to network changes.

4. **Protocols: IP, IPv6**:
   - **IP (Internet Protocol)**: A fundamental protocol of the internet, responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so they can travel across networks and reach their destination.
   - **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**: An upgraded version of IP designed to address the shortage of available IPv4 addresses. IPv6 offers a larger address space, improved security, and other features.
