1. **Differences between Traditional Payment Methods and Electronic Payment Methods**:
   - Traditional payment methods involve physical currency (cash) or paper-based instruments (checks), while electronic payment methods facilitate transactions electronically, without the need for physical exchange.
   - Electronic payment methods offer greater convenience, speed, and accessibility compared to traditional methods.
   - Traditional methods may require face-to-face interaction or manual processing, while electronic methods can be executed remotely and automatically.

2. **Types of Electronic Payment Methods**:
   - Credit Cards: Allow users to make purchases on credit, with payments settled at a later date.
   - Debit Cards: Deduct funds directly from the user's bank account for immediate payment.
   - Bank Transfers: Transfer funds electronically from one bank account to another.
   - Electronic Wallets: Store payment information securely for online transactions, such as PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.
   - Mobile Payments: Use mobile devices to make payments via NFC (Near Field Communication) or QR codes.
   - Cryptocurrencies: Digital currencies secured by cryptography, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

3. **E-Commerce Secure Payment System**:
   - Secure payment systems ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of electronic transactions.
   - They employ encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive payment information.
   - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are commonly used to encrypt data transmitted over the internet during payment transactions.

4. **Digital Certificate and Digital Signature**:
   - A digital certificate is an electronic document that verifies the identity of a person or entity and is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   - A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism used to authenticate the sender and ensure the integrity of electronic documents or messages.
   - Digital certificates are used to create digital signatures and establish secure communication channels in E-Commerce transactions.

5. **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**:
   - SSL is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over a computer network.
   - It encrypts data transmitted between a web server and a web browser, preventing unauthorized access or tampering of sensitive information.
   - SSL is commonly used to secure online transactions, such as E-Commerce purchases and online banking.

6. **SET (Secure Electronic Transaction)**:
   - SET is a protocol developed by Visa and Mastercard to secure electronic transactions over the internet.
   - It provides end-to-end encryption, authentication, and digital signature capabilities to ensure the security of online payments.
   - SET is designed to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to payment information.

7. **Cyber Cash Model**:
   - The Cyber Cash model is a digital payment system that allows users to make secure payments over the internet.
   - It uses digital tokens or electronic cash to facilitate transactions, with cryptographic mechanisms ensuring the authenticity and integrity of payments.

8. **Digicash**:
   - Digicash was one of the earliest digital cash systems, developed in the 1990s by David Chaum.
   - It allowed users to make anonymous payments over the internet using cryptographic techniques to ensure privacy and security.

9. **Smart Card**:
   - A smart card is a pocket-sized card with an embedded microchip that stores and processes data.
   - It can be used for various applications, including payment transactions, identification, access control, and loyalty programs.

10. **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**:
    - EDI is a computer-to-computer exchange of business documents in a standard electronic format between trading partners.
    - It facilitates seamless communication and transaction processing between businesses, streamlining supply chain management and procurement processes.
