1. **Wireless Networking**:* **Concept**: Wireless networking allows devices to connect and communicate without the need for physical cables. It uses radio frequency signals to transmit data between devices.
   * **Wireless Standards**: Standards like Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) define how wireless networks operate, ensuring compatibility and interoperability between devices.
   * **Common Terms**:
     * **WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)**: A network that connects devices wirelessly within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus.
     * **Wireless Access Point**: A device that enables wireless devices to connect to a wired network.
     * **Cellular**: Mobile communication technology that allows devices to connect to the internet via cellular networks.
     * **Attenuation**: The loss of signal strength as it travels through the air or obstacles.
     * **Antenna**: A device used to transmit and receive wireless signals.
     * **Microwave**: High-frequency radio waves used for wireless communication over short distances.
     * **Jamming**: Intentional interference with wireless signals to disrupt communication.
     * **SSID (Service Set Identifier)**: A unique identifier for a wireless network.
     * **Bluetooth**: A short-range wireless technology used for connecting devices over short distances.
     * **Wi-Fi Hotspots**: Locations with wireless access to the internet, often found in public places like cafes, airports, and hotels.
2. **Wi-Fi**:* Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, allowing devices to connect to a local area network (LAN) wirelessly.
   * It provides high-speed internet access and enables communication between devices within a certain range of a Wi-Fi access point.
3. **Wireless Attacks**:* **War Driving**: Driving around to find and map wireless networks and their vulnerabilities.
   * **War Walking/War Flying**: Walking or flying to discover and assess wireless networks.
   * **War Chalking**: Using symbols to mark locations with open or vulnerable Wi-Fi networks.
   * **Bluejacking**: Sending unsolicited messages or files to Bluetooth-enabled devices within range.
4. **Securing Wireless Networks**:* Use strong encryption protocols like WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) for securing Wi-Fi networks.
   * Change default SSIDs and passwords regularly.
   * Enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can connect to the network.
   * Disable SSID broadcasting to make the network less visible to unauthorized users.
   * Regularly update firmware and security patches for wireless routers and access points.
5. **Protocols & Proxy**:* **Protocols**: Communication rules and formats used by devices to exchange data over a network.
     - Examples include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTTPS (HTTP Secure), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SSH (Secure Shell), Telnet, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System), and POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3).
   * **Proxy**: An intermediary server that acts as a gateway between a client and a destination server.
     * **Forward Proxy**: Used by clients to access resources on the internet indirectly, hiding their IP addresses.
     * **Reverse Proxy**: Sits in front of web servers and forwards client requests to the appropriate server, enhancing security and performance.
   * **Proxy Chain**: A series of proxy servers used to route internet traffic anonymously, increasing privacy and security.
