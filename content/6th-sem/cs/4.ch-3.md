1. **Malware**:
   - Malware stands for malicious software, designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems or networks.
   - It can take various forms and has different purposes, including stealing sensitive information, causing system crashes, or hijacking resources.

2. **Types of Malware**:
   - **Virus**: Infects files and spreads when those files are executed.
   - **Worm**: Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without human intervention.
   - **Trojan Horse**: Disguises itself as legitimate software to deceive users into installing it, often with malicious intent.
   - **Spyware**: Secretly gathers and transmits user information without their knowledge or consent.
   - **Adware**: Displays unwanted advertisements or redirects web browser searches to promote certain products or websites.
   - **Ransomware**: Encrypts files or locks users out of their systems, demanding payment for their release.

3. **Type of Computer Viruses**:
   - **File Virus**: Infects executable files.
   - **Boot Sector Virus**: Infects the boot sector of storage devices.
   - **Macro Virus**: Infects documents or files containing macros.
   - **Email Virus**: Spreads through email attachments or links.
   - **Multi-variant Virus**: Mutates to avoid detection by antivirus software.

4. **Indications of Malware Attacks**:
   - Unusual system behavior or performance issues.
   - Pop-up ads or unwanted browser redirects.
   - Files or folders mysteriously disappearing or becoming inaccessible.
   - Unexplained changes in settings or configurations.
   - Anti-malware software alerts or warnings.

5. **Popular Antivirus Programs**:
   - Examples include Norton Antivirus, McAfee Antivirus, Avast Antivirus, Kaspersky Antivirus, and Bitdefender Antivirus.

6. **How Antivirus Identifies Viruses**:
   - **Signature-based Detection**: Matches the signature or unique code patterns of known viruses.
   - **Heuristics-based Detection**: Identifies suspicious behavior or characteristics that may indicate malware activity.
   - **Cloud-based Detection**: Utilizes online databases and resources to analyze files and identify potential threats.

7. **VirusTotal Website**:
   - VirusTotal is a free online service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs to detect malware using multiple antivirus engines and other tools.

8. **DOS (Denial of Service), IDS (Intrusion Detection System), IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**:
   - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overwhelms a system or network with excessive traffic, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.
   - **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: Coordinated DoS attacks from multiple sources to amplify their impact.
   - **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities or patterns that may indicate unauthorized access or attacks.
   - **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**: Similar to IDS but can also take action to block or mitigate detected threats in real-time.

9. **Snooping, Eavesdropping, Keyloggers, and Firewall**:
   - **Snooping/Eavesdropping**: Illegally intercepting and monitoring communications or data transmissions.
   - **Keyloggers**: Software or hardware devices that record keystrokes, often used to capture passwords or sensitive information.
   - **Firewall**: A security barrier that filters and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.

10. **BOTs/BOTNETS (Zombies)**:
   - **BOTs**: Automated software applications that perform repetitive tasks over the internet, often controlled remotely by an attacker.
   - **BOTNETS**: Networks of compromised computers or devices (BOTs) controlled by a central command (BOTMASTER) for malicious purposes, such as launching DDoS attacks or sending spam emails.

11. **Web Application-Based Threats**:
   - **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
   - **SQL Injection**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to execute unauthorized SQL queries.
   - **Command Injection**: Injecting malicious commands into input fields to manipulate server-side commands.
   - **Buffer Overflow**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to overwrite memory buffers and execute arbitrary code.
   - **Directory Traversal**: Accessing restricted directories or files by manipulating input parameters.
   - **Phishing Scams**: Deceptive techniques to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
   - **Drive-by Downloads**: Malicious software downloads that occur without the user's knowledge or consent, often through exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers or plugins.
