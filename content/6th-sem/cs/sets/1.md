## Set 1

**Group-A (Very Short Answer Type Question)**

(I) **Question:** What is the three-way handshake in networking?

   **Answer:** Three-way handshake in networking is a method used to establish a TCP connection between two devices. It involves three steps: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK.

(II) **Question:** Define NAT and its purpose.

   **Answer:** NAT (Network Address Translation) is a technique used to modify network address information in IP datagram headers while in transit across a traffic routing device. Its purpose is to conserve IP addresses and improve security by hiding internal IP addresses.

(III) **Question:** Name three goals of information security.

   **Answer:** The three goals of information security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability (often referred to as the CIA triad).

(IV) **Question:** Explain the difference between passive and active attacks.

   **Answer:** Passive attacks involve monitoring and eavesdropping on data transmissions without altering the data. Active attacks involve modifying or disrupting data transmission. Example: Passive - Eavesdropping on network traffic; Active - Man-in-the-middle attack.

(V) **Question:** What is the concept of steganography?

   **Answer:** Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

(VI) **Question:** Define hacking and mention two types of hackers.

   **Answer:** Hacking refers to unauthorized access into computer systems. Two types of hackers are White Hat (ethical hackers) and Black Hat (malicious hackers).

(VII) **Question:** List three types of cybercrimes.

   **Answer:** Three types of cybercrimes are identity theft, phishing scams, and ransomware attacks.

(VIII) **Question:** What is the phase of ethical hacking?

   **Answer:** The phase of ethical hacking involves reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, and covering tracks.

(IX) **Question:** Name two types of malware and provide brief descriptions.

   **Answer:** Two types of malware are viruses (self-replicating code that attaches itself to clean files) and worms (self-replicating malware that spreads without user interaction).

(X) **Question:** What are the indications of a malware attack?
    
**Answer:** Indications of a malware attack include slow performance, unusual pop-up messages, and unauthorized access to files or resources.

(XI) **Question:** Explain the concept of DoS and DDoS attacks.

**Answer:** DoS (Denial of Service) attack floods a network or server with traffic to disrupt services. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack uses multiple sources to overwhelm the target.

(XII) **Question:** Define the term "Cross-site scripting" (XSS).

**Answer:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Group-B (Short Answer Type Question)**

2. **Question:** Differentiate between passive and active attacks, and provide examples of each.
 
   **Answer:** Passive attacks involve monitoring and eavesdropping on data transmissions without altering the data, while active attacks involve modifying or disrupting data transmission. Example of passive attack: Packet sniffing. Example of active attack: Man-in-the-middle attack.

3. **Question:** Explain the concept of ethical hacking and outline the phases involved.

   **Answer:** Ethical hacking is the authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data to identify vulnerabilities. Phases involve reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, and covering tracks.

4. **Question:** Describe three types of cybercrimes covered under cyber laws in India and mention the associated punishments.

**Answer:** Three types of cybercrimes covered under cyber laws in India are hacking, phishing, and cyberstalking. Punishments vary depending on the severity of the crime and can include fines and imprisonment.

5. **Question:** Define malware and discuss three common types of malware, including their characteristics and effects.
   
**Answer:** Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Three common types are viruses (attach to clean files, self-replicate), worms (spread independently), and ransomware (encrypts files for ransom).

6. **Question:** Explain the working principle of intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). How do they differ from each other?

**Answer:** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and generate alerts. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) not only detect but also take action to block or prevent detected threats. IDS is passive, while IPS is active in preventing threats.

Sure, let's continue with Group C:

**Group-C (Long Answer Type Question)**

7. **Question:** 
- (a) Write about the types of proxy servers and explain the concept of proxy chaining.
- (b) Discuss three web application-based threats, including SQL injection, and provide measures to mitigate them.
- (c) Explain the concept of wireless networking and discuss common wireless attacks such as war driving and bluejacking. How can wireless networks be secured?

**Answer:**
- (a) Proxy servers can be categorized into different types based on their functionality, such as forward proxies, reverse proxies, open proxies, and transparent proxies. Proxy chaining involves using multiple proxy servers in a sequence to obscure the original source of internet traffic.
   
- (b) Three web application-based threats include SQL injection (exploiting vulnerabilities in database queries), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (injecting malicious scripts into web pages), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (tricking users into performing unintended actions). Mitigation measures include input validation, parameterized queries, and using security frameworks like OWASP.
   
- (c) Wireless networking involves the use of radio waves to transmit data between devices. Common wireless attacks include war driving (driving around to identify and exploit vulnerable wireless networks) and bluejacking (sending unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices). Wireless networks can be secured by using strong encryption (like WPA2), changing default passwords, disabling SSID broadcasting, and implementing MAC address filtering.

8. **Question:** 
- (a) Describe the protocols HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP, including their functions and port numbers.
- (b) Discuss different types of password attacks and suggest measures to create strong passwords and stay secure in the digital world.
- (c) Explain the concept of denial of service (DoS) attacks and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Mention strategies to mitigate their impact.

   **Answer:**
- (a) HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for transmitting web pages and other web content. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to ensure data confidentiality. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring files between a client and a server. Their port numbers are HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and FTP (20 for data transfer, 21 for control).
   
- (b) Different types of password attacks include brute force attacks (trying all possible combinations), dictionary attacks (using a list of common passwords), and phishing attacks (tricking users into revealing passwords). Measures to create strong passwords include using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, avoiding dictionary words, and enabling multi-factor authentication.
   
- (c) Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to disrupt the availability of a service by overwhelming it with traffic or resources. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks involve multiple sources coordinating to launch a DoS attack. Mitigation strategies include implementing firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and content delivery networks, as well as using rate limiting and traffic filtering techniques.
