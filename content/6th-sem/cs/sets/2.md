**Answer:** Ethical hacking is the authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data to identify vulnerabilities and improve security.

(IV) **Question:** What is the primary purpose of NAT?

**Answer:** The primary purpose of NAT (Network Address Translation) is to conserve public IP addresses and improve network security by hiding internal IP addresses.

(V) **Question:** Mention two types of malware and their characteristics.

**Answer:** Two types of malware are viruses (attach to clean files, self-replicate) and ransomware (encrypts files for ransom).

(VI) **Question:** Explain the concept of steganography.

**Answer:** Steganography is the practice of concealing a message or data within another file, image, or video to hide its existence.

(VII) **Question:** Define DoS and DDoS attacks.

**Answer:** DoS (Denial of Service) attack floods a network or server with traffic to disrupt services. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack uses multiple sources to overwhelm the target.

(VIII) **Question:** What are the essential components of a wireless network?
   
   **Answer:** Essential components of a wireless network include access points (APs), wireless clients, and wireless routers.

(IX) **Question:** Name two types of proxy servers.

**Answer:** Two types of proxy servers are forward proxies and reverse proxies.

(X) **Question:** Define the term "Cross-site scripting" (XSS).

 **Answer:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

(XI) **Question:** Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric crptography.
    
**Answer:** Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric cryptography uses different keys for encryption and decryption.

(XII) **Question:** What is the role of a firewall in network security?

 **Answer:** A firewall acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

**Group-B (Short Answer Type Question)**

2. **Question:** Differentiate between a virus and a worm. Provide examples of each.

    **Answer:** A virus attaches itself to clean files and requires user interaction for propagation. Example: Melissa virus. A worm is self-replicating and spreads independently without user interaction. Example: Conficker worm.

3. **Question:** Explain the concept of cyber terrorism and discuss the types of cybercrimes covered under cyber laws in India.
    
    **Answer:** Cyber terrorism involves using computer technology to launch attacks against networks, causing fear or harm to individuals or society. Types of cybercrimes covered under cyber laws in India include hacking, phishing, identity theft, and cyberstalking.

4. **Question:** Describe the phases involved in ethical hacking and discuss the significance of each phase.
   
   **Answer:** Phases of ethical hacking include reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, and covering tracks. Each phase helps identify vulnerabilities, assess security measures, and improve overall security posture.

5. **Question:** Define DoS and DDoS attacks. Discuss the mechanisms used to mitigate their impact.
   
   **Answer:** DoS (Denial of Service) attack floods a network or server with traffic, while DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack uses multiple sources to overwhelm the target. Mechanisms to mitigate their impact include implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and rate limiting.

6. **Question:** Discuss three web application-based threats and provide measures to prevent them.
   
   **Answer:** Three web application-based threats include SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Measures to prevent them include input validation, parameterized queries, and using security frameworks like OWASP.


**Group-C (Long Answer Type Question)**

7. **Question:** 
- (a) Explain the OSI and TCP/IP network reference models, highlighting their differences and similarities.
- (b) Describe different types of proxy servers and their roles in network security.
- (c) Discuss the various wireless attacks and suggest countermeasures to enhance wireless network security.

   **Answer:**
- (a) The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP model are both conceptual frameworks used to understand and standardize the functions of networking protocols. The OSI model consists of seven layers, while the TCP/IP model has four layers. Both models include layers for application, transport, network, and link, although the naming and functionality may vary slightly between them.
   
- (b) Proxy servers can be categorized into different types based on their functionality, such as forward proxies, reverse proxies, open proxies, and transparent proxies. They act as intermediaries between clients and servers, providing various functions such as caching, filtering, and anonymity. Proxy servers enhance network security by providing an additional layer of protection against external threats and helping to control and monitor network traffic.
   
- (c) Wireless networks are vulnerable to various attacks, including eavesdropping, rogue access points, and deauthentication attacks. Countermeasures to enhance wireless network security include implementing strong encryption protocols (such as WPA2), enabling network authentication mechanisms (like WPA-Enterprise), regularly updating firmware and software, conducting regular security audits, and using intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) specifically designed for wireless networks.

8. **Question:** 
- (a) Discuss the role of encryption in information security. Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
- (b) Describe the working principle of intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). How do they contribute to network security?
- (c) Explain the significance of protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SSH in data communication and network security.

   **Answer:**
- (a) Encryption plays a crucial role in information security by converting plaintext data into ciphertext to protect it from unauthorized access during transmission or storage. Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric cryptography uses different keys for these operations.
   
- (b) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network traffic for suspicious activities or patterns, generate alerts, and notify administrators of potential security breaches. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) not only detect but also take proactive measures to block or prevent detected threats, thus enhancing network security.
   
- (c) HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for transmitting web pages and other web content, while HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) provides a secure version of HTTP by encrypting data using SSL/TLS protocols. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring files between a client and a server, and SSH (Secure Shell) provides secure remote access and file transfer capabilities. These protocols are essential for data communication and network security as they ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during transmission.
