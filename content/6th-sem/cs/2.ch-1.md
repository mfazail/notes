1. **Fundamentals of Data Communication and Networking:** This involves understanding how data is generated, transmitted, and received across networks. It covers concepts like protocols, packet switching, and data transmission techniques.

2. **Network Reference Models: OS and TCP/IP Models:** Reference models like the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) models provide a conceptual framework for understanding network architecture and communication protocols.

3. **3-way Handshake and TCP Flags:** The 3-way handshake is a method used by TCP to establish a connection between a client and server. It involves three steps: SYN (synchronize), SYN-ACK (synchronize acknowledgment), and ACK (acknowledge). TCP flags are control bits within the TCP header used to manage aspects like connection establishment, termination, and error handling.

4. **Network Address Translation (NAT) Concept:** NAT allows multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address. It translates private IP addresses to public ones when communicating with external networks, enhancing security and conserving IP addresses.

5. **Network Transmission Media and Network Devices:** Transmission media include wired (e.g., Ethernet, fiber optics) and wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) mediums for transmitting data. Network devices like routers, switches, hubs, and modems facilitate data transmission and network connectivity.

6. **Security Definition:** Security encompasses measures taken to protect systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access or misuse. It involves implementing policies, procedures, and technologies to safeguard against threats and vulnerabilities.

7. **Information Security Goals (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability):** Confidentiality ensures that data is only accessible to authorized users. Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and trustworthy. Availability ensures that data and resources are accessible when needed, without interruption.

8. **Basic Concepts of Cryptography and Steganography:** Cryptography involves encrypting and decrypting messages to ensure confidentiality and integrity. It utilizes algorithms and keys to secure data. Steganography hides secret messages within other non-secret data, concealing the existence of the message.
