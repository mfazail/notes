**Web Programming**:
Web programming involves creating and maintaining websites using various technologies and languages to build interactive and dynamic web pages.

**Introduction to HTML**:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of web pages. It uses tags to structure content and display it in a browser.

**Editors**:
HTML can be written in any text editor, but there are specialized HTML editors that offer syntax highlighting, error checking, and other helpful features.

**Elements**:
HTML elements are building blocks of a web page. They consist of opening and closing tags that define the structure and content of a page.

**Attributes**:
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are usually placed within the opening tag.

**Heading**:
Headings define the hierarchy of content on a web page, ranging from h1 (highest importance) to h6 (lowest importance).

**Paragraph**:
The <p> element is used to create paragraphs of text on a web page.

**Formatting**:
HTML provides tags to control text formatting, like <strong> for bold and <em> for italic.

**Link**:
The <a> element creates hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different web pages.

**Head**:
The <head> section of an HTML document contains meta-information, like the title of the page and links to external resources.

**Table**:
Tables are used to organize data into rows and columns. They consist of the <table>, <tr> (table row), and <td> (table data) elements.

**List**:
HTML offers ordered (<ol>) and unordered (<ul>) lists to present items in a list format.

**Block**:
Block-level elements create distinct sections on a page and often start on a new line, while inline elements flow within text.

**Layout**:
HTML elements can be used to structure the layout of a page, defining headers, footers, sidebars, and main content areas.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**:
CSS is used to style HTML elements, controlling their appearance, layout, and formatting.

**Form**:
Forms allow users to input data and submit it to a server for processing. The <form> element wraps form elements like text fields and buttons.

**Iframe**:
The <iframe> element embeds external content within a webpage, like maps or videos.

**Colors**:
Colors can be specified using color names or color values.

**Color Name**:
HTML supports color names like "red," "blue," etc., to define text and background colors.

**Color Value**:
Color values can be specified using hexadecimal or RGB codes to achieve precise color choices.

**Image Maps**:
Image maps allow you to define clickable regions on an image. The <area> element is used to define these clickable areas.

**Attributes of Image Area**:
Attributes like shape, coords, and href are used to define the shape, coordinates, and destination of clickable areas within an image map.

**Extensible Markup Language (XML)**:
XML is a markup language similar to HTML, used for structuring and storing data in a customizable format.

**CGI Scripts**:
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts allow web servers to interact with external programs to generate dynamic content.

**GET and POST Methods**:
GET and POST are HTTP methods used to send data from a client (browser) to a server. GET appends data to the URL, while POST sends data in the request body.
