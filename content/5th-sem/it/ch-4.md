**Network Security Techniques**:
Network security involves implementing measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources on a network.

**Password and Authentication**:
Passwords and authentication methods are used to verify the identity of users and ensure secure access to systems and data.

**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:
VPNs create encrypted tunnels over public networks, allowing users to securely access private networks from remote locations.

**IP Security**:
IPsec is a suite of protocols that provides secure communication by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet within a communication session.

**Security in Electronic Transactions**:
Security measures are crucial when conducting transactions online, protecting sensitive information during e-commerce activities.

**Secure Socket Layer (SSL)**:
SSL is a cryptographic protocol that ensures secure data transmission over the internet. It's often used for secure online transactions and web browsing.

**Secure Shell (SSH)**:
SSH is a secure communication protocol used for remote access to servers and secure data exchange.

**Introduction to Firewall**:
A firewall is a security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

**Packet Filtering**:
Packet-filtering firewalls analyze individual packets of data to determine whether they should be allowed through based on specified rules.

**Stateful Firewall**:
Stateful firewalls track the state of active connections and allow or deny traffic based on the context of the connection.

**Application Layer Firewall**:
Application layer firewalls operate at the application layer of the OSI model and can understand and filter traffic based on specific application protocols.

**Proxy**:
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet. It can provide anonymity, caching, and content filtering.
