**Q1. What is a firewall? How does it work?**
- **Firewall:** A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

- **How it works:**
  - **Packet Filtering:** Examines packets and allows or blocks them based on predefined rules.
  - **Proxy:** Acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, filtering requests and responses.
  - **Stateful Inspection:** Tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context.
  - **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Analyzes the content of data packets for more granular control.

**Q2. Four factors needed for secured networks:**
1. **Firewalls:** To monitor and control network traffic.
2. **Encryption:** Protecting data through encryption algorithms.
3. **Access Control:** Restricting user access to resources based on permissions.
4. **Regular Updates and Patch Management:** Keeping systems and software up-to-date to fix vulnerabilities.

**Q3. Short Notes: SSL, SSH, Firewall:**
- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):** Provides secure communication over a computer network, commonly used for secure transactions on the web.
  
- **SSH (Secure Shell):** A protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.

- **Firewall:** A network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.

**Q5. What is a firewall? Types of Firewall:**
- **Firewall:** A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

- **Types:**
  1. **Packet Filtering Firewalls:** Examines packets and filters them based on predefined rules.
  2. **Proxy Firewalls:** Acts as an intermediary for requests between clients and servers.
  3. **Stateful Inspection Firewalls:** Tracks the state of active connections for more intelligent decision-making.
  4. **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW):** Integrates additional features like intrusion prevention and application awareness.

**Q6. Stateful Packet Filtering:**
- **Stateful Packet Filtering:** A firewall technology that monitors the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic. It keeps track of the state of active connections and allows or blocks packets based on the information gathered.

### Network Protocols and Multimedia:

**Q7. What is a Firewall? How does a Firewall work? What are the different Types of Firewalls, Explain each type briefly? How is Firewall different from an Antivirus? What are the different functions of a Firewall?**
- **Firewall:** A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

- **How it works:**
  - **Packet Filtering:** Examines packets and allows or blocks them based on predefined rules.
  - **Proxy:** Acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, filtering requests and responses.
  - **Stateful Inspection:** Tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context.
  - **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Analyzes the content of data packets for more granular control.

- **Different Types:**
  1. **Packet Filtering Firewalls:** Examines packets and filters them based on predefined rules.
  2. **Proxy Firewalls:** Acts as an intermediary for requests between clients and servers.
  3. **Stateful Inspection Firewalls:** Tracks the state of active connections for more intelligent decision-making.
  4. **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW):** Integrates additional features like intrusion prevention and application awareness.

- **Difference from Antivirus:**
  - Firewalls focus on monitoring and controlling network traffic.
  - Antiviruses focus on detecting and removing malicious software (malware) on individual devices.

- **Functions of a Firewall:**
  1. **Packet Filtering:** Decides which packets are allowed or blocked.
  2. **Proxying:** Acts as an intermediary for network requests.
  3. **Stateful Inspection:** Monitors the state of active connections.
  4. **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Analyzes the content of data packets.
  5. **Intrusion Prevention:** Detects and prevents unauthorized access.

### Networking and VoIP:

**Q9. Short Note on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Multimedia Applications, RSVP, RTP, RTCP, and RTSP:**
- **VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol):** A technology that enables voice communication and multimedia sessions over the internet.

- **Multimedia Applications:** Applications that involve the use of various media types, such as text, audio, images, and video.

- **RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol):** A network protocol used to reserve resources across a network.

- **RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol):** A protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks.

- **RTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol):** A protocol for monitoring the quality of service and controlling the transmission of multimedia data.

- **RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol):** A network control protocol for the delivery of streaming media.

**Q10. How VoIP works?**
- **VoIP Working:**
  1. **Analog-to-Digital Conversion:** Converts voice signals into digital data.
  2. **Packetization:** Breaks the digital data into small packets.
  3. **Transmission:** Sends packets over the internet using IP.
  4. **Digital-to-Analog Conversion:** Converts received digital data back into voice signals.

**Q11. Advantages and disadvantages of VoIP:**
- **Advantages:**
  1. Cost-Effective.
  2. Flexibility and Mobility.
  3. Integration with Other Services.
  4. Advanced Features.

- **Disadvantages:**
  1. Dependence on Internet Connection.
  2. Quality of Service Issues.
  3. Security Concerns.
  4. Power Dependency.

**Q12. What is a codec? Why are Codecs Needed? What is a Container Format? Difference Between Video Streaming Codecâ€™s and Video Container Formats. Video Streaming Codecs (H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, VP9, AV1, H.266/VVC) Relationship between Bandwidth and Video Streaming Codecs:**
- **Codec (Coder-Decoder):** A software or hardware component that compresses and decompresses digital media.

- **Why Codecs are Needed:**
  - Reduce File Sizes.
  - Facilitate Transmission.
  - Maintain Quality.

- **Container Format:** A file format that contains audio and video data, metadata, and synchronization information.

- **Difference Between Codecs and Container Formats:**
  - **Codec:** Deals with compression and decompression of audio and video.
  - **Container Format:** Packages audio, video, and metadata into a single file.

- **Video Streaming Codecs:**
  1. **H.264/AVC:** Widely used for video compression.
  2. **H.265/HEVC:** Offers improved compression efficiency.
  3. **VP9:** Open-source codec developed by Google.
  4. **

AV1:** Open-source and royalty-free video codec.
  5. **H.266/VVC:** A successor to H.265, promising higher compression efficiency.

- **Relationship between Bandwidth and Video Streaming Codecs:**
  - Efficient codecs can deliver better video quality at lower bandwidth.

**Q13. What is Metadata? What is Search Engine Optimization?**
- **Metadata:** Metadata is data that provides information about other data. In the context of digital content, it includes information like file size, creation date, author, etc.

- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** SEO is the process of optimizing a website or web page to improve its visibility in search engine results. It involves various techniques to enhance the website's ranking and increase organic traffic.

**Q14. What is SEO description? What do you mean by SEO Keywords?**
- **SEO Description:** An SEO description is a meta tag that provides a brief summary of a web page's content. It appears in search engine results and influences click-through rates.

- **SEO Keywords:** SEO keywords are specific words or phrases that users are likely to search for. Integrating relevant keywords into website content helps improve its search engine ranking.
