CN CH3

1. **Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)**:
   PPP is a data link protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes, often over serial connections. It provides authentication, error detection, and compression features.

2. **FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)**:
   FDDI is a high-speed LAN protocol using fiber optic cables for data transmission. It supports token passing as the medium access method and offers high reliability and fault tolerance.

3. **Token Bus and Token Ring**:
   Token Bus and Token Ring are LAN protocols where devices pass a token to gain access to the network. In Token Bus, devices are connected in a linear bus topology, while in Token Ring, devices are connected in a physical ring.

4. **Reservation and Polling**:
   Reservation protocols allocate time slots for devices to transmit. Polling protocols involve a central device querying connected devices to determine if they have data to send.

5. **Concentration**:
   Concentration involves collecting data from multiple lower-speed lines and transmitting them on a higher-speed line. It helps optimize bandwidth usage.

6. **Multiple Access Protocols**:
   These protocols determine how multiple devices share a common communication channel:
   - **ALOHA**: Devices transmit data whenever they have it, which can lead to collisions and inefficiency.
   - **CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)**: Devices listen for carrier signals before transmitting to avoid collisions.
   - **FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)**: Frequency bands are divided among users for simultaneous transmission.
   - **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)**: Users take turns transmitting in different time slots.
   - **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**: Users transmit using different codes that can be separated at the receiver.

7. **Ethernet**:
   Ethernet is a widely used LAN technology that employs CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) for medium access. It uses Ethernet frames to encapsulate and transmit data packets.
